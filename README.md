Thanks for checking out my github!

Here you'll find my progress in learning C, C++, Java, SQL, Python, and more!

I am an upcoming accounting graduate (Dec 2022) who was always had an interest in programming (was on the software development team for my high school FIRST robotics team)
but only recently got serious about making my passion my career. I am currently pursuing CPA licensure alongside my software development learning, and am seeking
entry level positions in Software Development/Engineering.

Above all else, I am trying to keep learning and growing, that's what drew me to programming!
